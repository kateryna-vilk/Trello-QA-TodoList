# Trello QA Management Portfolio (To-Do List App)

This portfolio project demonstrates using Trello for a complete QA process, including Test Management and Bug Tracking.

The application under test was this simple To-Do List web app: https://todolist.james.am/#/

## Part 1: The QA Process Board 
The Trello board is structured to manage the entire QA lifecycle: from test planning and execution to bug tracking and verification.

## Part 2: Test Scenario Structure (CRUD)

## Part 3: Example Defect Report 
The board also served as a bug-tracking system. This is an example of a high-quality defect report, with all necessary details (Priority, Steps, Expected/Actual Results).
